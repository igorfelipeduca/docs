# Instagram Feed Fetch Script

## This should be ran in a browser

This script fetches the latest posts from an Instagram account and saves them to a JSON file. It uses the Instagram Basic Display API to fetch the posts and the `fs` module to save them to a JSON file.

```javascript
let imageUrls = Array.from(
  document.querySelectorAll("._aagv img"),
  (img) => img.src
);
```

After that, you can go ahead and run

```javascript
console.log({ imageUrls });
```

in order to see the image URLs in the console.
