# What is this all about?

This docs were created with the goal to store all of my public Building Blocks.

## Main goal

I am always tweeting and talking with some people online about how I love to create re-usable blocks of code in order to improve my productivity. BUT, I never turned them public, so, now, I want to make my building blocks available for everyone to take advantage of.
